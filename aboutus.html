							<h2><strong>About Us</strong></h2>
						</header>
						<h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>
						<p>Pavlov Institute is a non-profit making social organisation organised by medical
							professionals, scientists and social workers launched formally in the year 1959, working in
							the field of biology, sociology, psychology and psychiatry (mental health), based primarily
							on Pavlovian neuroscience. </p>

						<p> Any person can associate himself with this Institute with a minimum qualification of
							graduation preferably in science subjects and with a progressive, materialistic outlook.
							Persons interested in the scientific works of Pavlov can also be a bonafide member of this
							Institute. </p>

						<p> Dr. Dhirendranath Gangopadhyay (1911-1998) is the founder-father of this Institute. He tried
							to propagate the scientific principles and its social relevance of academician Ivan
							Petrovich Pavlov (1849-1936), so if somebody wants to be acquainted with this Institute then
							it is necessary to be acquainted with Pavlov and Dr. Ganguly. On other words the life and
							works of Dr. Ganguly is the history of this Institute. </p>

						<h3 id="history">Historical Background</h3>

						<p> Dhirendranath (an alienist?) in our judgement, may be considered one of the pioneers in the
							field of psychiatry and social science in India. </p>

						<p> A product of so called Bengali Renaissance, Dhirendranath had multiple qualities. He was a
							psychiatrist, a dramatist, a science writer who wrote in Bengali, a psychologist, editor of
							Bengali quartarly magazine Manabmon and a Marxist social scientist. Apart from all these he
							had
							many more qualities. Inspite of all these he can easily stake his claim mainly as an
							original
							psychiatrist. Among those who have worked as psychiatrists for a long time in India,
							Dhirendranath was unique and independent. Yet Dhirendranath was not well known as a
							psychiatrist
							outside the circle of those patients who were greatly benefited by him. Still it may be
							recorded
							that he created a new genre in the field of psychiatry. We shall do our best to reveal that
							genre analysing his thoughts as also his great work-ability. </p>

						<p> Dhirendranath was India's only follower of Nobel Prize winner and one of world's best
							physiologists I. P. Pavlov. Dhirendranath worked on the Indian soil principally basing his
							research on Pavlov's work on physiology and psychology. How far was he successful or what
							was
							his failure in such a field? This is mostly true in our country where it is indeed difficult
							to
							find a truly scientific mind. </p>

						<p> Considering the above we shall judge the mental ability of Dhirendranath always remembering
							how
							great was his love for this fallen country of his. He never could think anything minus the
							welfare of the people of this country. That made him a silent worker sacrificing his
							personal
							ambition and social establishment. </p>

						<h3 id="activities">Activities Of The Institute</h3>

						<p> We highly revere our beloved teacher Dr. Dhirendranath Gangopadhyay, who had contributed
							some
							original thoughts in Indian psychiatry.</p>

						<p> Motto of Pavlov Institute is to provide comprehensive, professionally faultless and socially
							just psychiatry services. Professional excellence, as opposed to crass mercenarism, is
							ingrained
							into our work ethic. Social commitment comes on top of our agenda.</p>

						<p> Deeply committed to our scientific tradition, we see ourselves as a link between the
							accumulated
							knowledge and the continuously developing research. Scientific principles, and not outdated
							dogmas, are the only yardsticks welcome employ while determining the path to follow.</p>

						<p> The importance of developing a psychosomatic approach towards human illness is now
							well-established in advanced countries. But in India it still awaits its due recognition. It
							is
							therefore a matter of pride that Pavlov Institute under the guidance of Dhirendranath has
							been
							the only Institute in India to harp on this theme for the last fifty years.
						<br><br>
						The present activities of the Institute include:
						</p>

						<p>
							1. Running a regular psychiatric clinic in the heart of the city of Kolkata. Qualified
							psychiatrists and psychologist are available there seven days a week for general
							counselling, psychotherapy, parents guidance clinic, family therapy, career guidance,
							couple therapy, family counselling etc.
							<br>
							2. Running reserach project and rehabilitation programme in substance-abuse disorder,
							community psychiatry and correctional psychiatry.
							<br>
							3. Actively participating along with the other social service organisations specially
							those who are working in 'Mental Health Movement' in this State.
							<br>
							4. Construction of a permanent hospital and centre named 'Pavlov Bhavan' at <i>[to be
								decided]</i>, for all the activities of this Institute.
							<br>
							5. Preparing a course of postgraduate diploma in psychological counselling and upgraded
							it to postgraduate degree course.
							<br>
							6. Preparation is going on to start two rural treatment and rehabiltation centres one at
							near Ghatal, East Medinipore and another near Bolepur (Santiniketan), Birbhum.
						</p>

						<p> We are working for the last fifty years providing service to the psychiatry patients. Here
							we
							follow the scientific principles of Pavlov specially his formulation of individual brain
							type
							and psychotherapy, that we formulate hypnotic-sugestion therapy. It is the unique
							psychotherapy
							developed by Platanov, Pavlov's disciple on his theory of higher nervous system and
							subsequently
							enriched by Dhirendranath on Indian condition and along with our cultural tradition. Here
							'word'
							is used as conditioned stimulus and psychotherapeutic factor.
						</p>
						<p> "It is necessary to have a creative imagination to see a problem", wrote Professor Einstein.
							So
							we have to develop a creative imagination to see a problem of 'March to Sound Mental Health
							for
							All in 21st century'. Here the idea is to make an honest and sincere introspection as to why
							the
							people of India cannot get even the primary health care (where mental health is still a
							luxury
							item) after so many years of independence. And why we the providers should be least
							concerned
							about the matter. Now it has become evident that 'modern medicine' is too expensive a
							commodity
							for the fifty crore poor people of this country. The highly complex superspeciality and
							sophisticated compartmentalisation have added to the process. And it has also complicated
							the
							process to achieve a sound mental health.
						</p>
						<p> But it has been understood that what is essential for man is at least to achieve the goal of
							not
							only sound physical health but also sound mental health. We therefore need something in the
							form
							of counselling, pychotherapy, group discussion, family-therapy etc. which are cheap and
							eco-friendly more in tune with the culture of our people. We have a rich heritage of such
							system
							in the poor, old, community based structure of our society. People suffer and finding no
							other
							alternative embrace only the insufficient traditional art of healing, however native it may
							be.
							This 'suffering in silence' has kept alive all forms of the traditional system. To extract
							an
							exact science from it is our responsibility.
						</p>
						<p> Science has interacted with an influenced history in no less a degree than history has
							influenced science. The growth and development of all our great traditions cannot be
							understood
							without science; but equally science cannot be understood unless it is seen as a natural
							part of
							the common tradition. So the situation demands a meticulous study of the history of science,
							especially the history of medicine and particularly mental health. We have to be keen to
							find
							out the dynamic equilibruim between the mechanistic approach of modern medicine (specially
							it
							can be said of biological psychiatry) and the vitalist approach of all traditional art of
							healing, often tinged with mystical magical approach and religious connotations.
						</p>
						<p> For the last couple of years, all our traditional systems have acquired a solid economic
							basis
							with investment of more capital, more brain, more effort leading to a virtual gold rush. All
							around we find management training with 'Dhyan', 'Meditation', 'Relaxation therapy', 'Yoga
							thearpy' etc.. The positive side of it is that in the process it is struggling hard to
							become a
							standard useful, effective and ready for any quantitative analysis, but the most unfortunate
							thing is, it has gradually detached itself from the greater part of society and social
							consciousness.
						</p>
						<p> In this cobweb of obfuscation we are in a condition of poverty in the midst of plenty. On
							one
							side we have rich heritage, rich resources of all kinds; on the other side our people are
							forced
							to maintain a beastly life of bare subsistance. Applications of the bare minimum of
							scientific
							knowledge to combat disease without changing patterns of exploitation has had the result of
							allowing the population to increase and has thus provoked further deterioration of the
							quality
							of life and exhausation of natural resources.
						</p>

						<h3 id="objective">Our Objective</h3>

						<p>Staffed by experienced and committed doctors and paramedics, our professionally managed
							centres has three goals before it. Firstly, to develop a properly equipped research
							network geared towards conducting an in-depth study of the integration of psychosomatic
							nature of human illness. Secondly, the centres, while fully utilising the benefits of
							modern medico-technical progress, will try its best to unburden the patients of those
							unnecessary trapping - both diagnostic and therapeutic - which have, unfortunately,
							become the trade mark of conventional treatment. Thirdly, to inculcate in doctors and
							para-medics a spirit of dedicated service to the suffering humanity, particularly those
							who have very little to fall upon. It is this spirit that will act as the motivating and
							cementing factor of the centre.</p>

						<p>We have such plans for the immediate future: Students and follower of Pavlov and
							Dhirendranath with renewed vigour and augmented resources, have come up with plans to
							realize his ideas. On the anvil are quite a few projects. Among them, the most ambitious
							one is the building of a permanent premises which will house all the activities of the
							Institute under one roof.</p>

						<p>Apart from having state of the art indoor and outdoor departments, the institute will
							shortly initiate postgraduate diploma courses in :
							<br><br>
							1. <i>Medical Counselling</i>
							<br>
							2. <i>Course for Primary Care-givers</i>
							<br>
							3. <i>Continued medical education in psychiatry</i>
