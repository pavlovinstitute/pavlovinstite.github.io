				<div id="content">

					<p> <strong>Pavlov Institute</strong> is a non-profit social organisation, organised by medical
						professionals,
						scientists and social workers, launched formally in the year 1959, working in the field of
						biology, sociology, psychology and psychiatry (mental health), based primarily on Pavlovian
						neuroscience.

						Any person can associate himself or herself with this Institute with a minimum qualification of
						graduation
						preferably in science subjects and with a progressive, materialistic outlook. Persons interested
						in the scientific works of Pavlov can also be a bonafide member of this Institute.

						<strong>Dr. Dhirendranath Gangopadhyay</strong> (1911-1998) is the founder-father of this
						Institute. He tried to
						propagate the scientific principles and its social relevance of academician <strong>Ivan
							Petrovich
							Pavlov</strong> (1849-1936), so if somebody wants to be acquainted with this Institute then
						it is
						necessary to be acquainted with Pavlov and Dr. Ganguly. On other words the life and works of Dr.
						Ganguly is the history of this Institute.

								<h2><strong>Our Objective</strong></h2>
							</header>
							<a href="aboutus.html#objective" class="image featured"><img src="images/brain3.jpg"
									alt="" /></a>
							<p>Staffed by experienced and committed doctors and paramedics, our professionally managed
								centres has three goals before it. Firstly, to develop a properly equipped research
								network geared towards conducting an in-depth study of the integration of psychosomatic
								nature of human illness. Secondly, the centres, while fully utilising the benefits of
								modern medico-technical progress, will try its best to unburden the patients of those
								unnecessary trapping - both diagnostic and therapeutic - which have, unfortunately,
								become the trade mark of conventional treatment. Thirdly, to inculcate in doctors and
								para-medics a spirit of dedicated service to the suffering humanity, particularly those
								who have very little to fall upon. It is this spirit that will act as the motivating and
								cementing factor of the centre.</p>

							<p>We have such plans for the immediate future: Students and follower of Pavlov and
								Dhirendranath with renewed vigour and augmented resources, have come up with plans to
								realize his ideas. On the anvil are quite a few projects. Among them, the most ambitious
								one is the building of a permanent premises which will house all the activities of the
								Institute under one roof.</p>

							<p>Apart from having state of the art indoor and outdoor departments, the institute will
								shortly initiate postgraduate diploma courses in :
								<br><br>
								1. <i>Medical Counselling</i>
								<br>
								2. <i>Course for Primary care-givers</i>
								<br>
								3. <i>Continued medical education in psychiatry</i>
							</p>

							<p>Rehabilitation and Parents-guidance centres are also in the offering.</p>

								<h2><strong>Activities of the Institute</strong></h2>
							</header>
							<a href="aboutus.html#activities" class="image featured"><img src="images/mind.png"
									alt="" /></a>
							<p>We highly revere our beloved teacher Dr. Dhirendranath Gangopadhyay, who had contributed
								some original thoughts in Indian psychiatry.

								Motto of Pavlov Institute is to provide comprehensive, professionally faultless and
								socially just psychiatry services. Professional excellence, as opposed to crass
								mercenarism, is ingrained into our work ethic. Social commitment comes on top of our
								agenda.

								Deeply committed to our scientific tradition, we see ourselves as a link between the
								accumulated knowledge and the continuously developing research. Scientific principles,
								and not outdated dogmas, are the only yardsticks welcome employ while determining the
								path to follow.</p>

							<p>The importance of developing a psychosomatic approach towards human illness is now
								well-established in advanced countries. But in India it still awaits its due
								recognition. It is therefore a matter of pride that Pavlov Institute under the guidance
								of Dhirendranath has been the only Institute in India to harp on this theme for the last
								fifty years.

								The present activities of the Institute include : </p>

							<p>
								<!-- <br><br> -->
								1. Running a regular psychiatric clinic in the heart of the city of Kolkata. Qualified
								psychiatrists and psychologist are available there seven days a week for general
								counselling, psychotherapy, parents guidance clinic, family therapy, career guidance,
								couple therapy, family counselling etc.
								<br><br>
								2. Running reserach project and rehabilitation programme in substance-abuse disorder,
								community psychiatry and correctional psychiatry.
								<br><br>
								3. Actively participating along with the other social service organisations specially
								those who are working in 'Mental Health Movement' in this State.
								<br><br>
								4. Construction of a permanent hospital and centre named 'Pavlov Bhavan' at <i>[to be
									decided]</i>, for all the activities of this Institute.
								<br><br>
								5. Preparing a course of postgraduate diploma in psychological counselling and upgraded
								it to postgraduate degree course.
								<br><br>
								6. Preparation is going on to start two rural treatment and rehabiltation centres one at
								near Ghatal, East Medinipore and another near Bolepur (Santiniketan), Birbhum.
							</p>

							<p>Rehabilitation and Parents-guidance centres are also in the offering.</p>

										<p>Dhirendranath discussed and did his research on Pavlov all his life and he
											may easily be
											called a pioneer in this field in the whole of Asia. He introduced the
											talent of Pavlov
											as a scientist in our country otherwise the latter would have been known to
											only a few
											people confirmed in the text books only. He was the first to reveal the
											scientific
											genius of Pavlov and his influence on our daily life and thought and that
											alone accounts
											how a discussion on Pavlov and Dhirendranath is one and the same.

										<p>Basic research on neurophysiology had started fairly at the time of Pavlov
											and the curious readers would do well to read Daniel Todes Pavlov's
											Physiology Factory, published by Jhon Hopkins University in 2002. However
											Pavlov had worked on Russia's tradition of systematic research on physiology
											in such areas as cardiovascular system, digestive system, autonomic nervous
											system etc.. Working that way Pavlov automatically entered into the
											baffeling 'psychic secretion'.

											R.G.Kar Medical College but it was not systematically continued the way it

										<p>Dhirendranath in his young age helped the secret terrorist parties working as

											whole society of his motherland was his entire life's research laboratory.
											He
											used to think, write and discuss about every subject concerning the people
											and
											the society of this country. But he hated disturbance, unlike Pavlov, as he
											lacked Pavlov's courage. He used to shy away from anything that seemed to
											brew
											any disturbance and fearing insult used to think a number of times before
											asking
											for any help from anyony for his Institution.</p>
