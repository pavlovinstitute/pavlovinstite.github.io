                        <h3 id="whypavlov">Why Pavlov ?</h3>
                        <p> Dhirendranath discussed and did his research on Pavlov all his life and he may easily be
                            called
                            a pioneer in this field in the whole of Asia. He introduced the talent of Pavlov as a
                            scientist
                            in our country otherwise the latter would have been known to only a few people confirmed in
                            the
                            text books only. He was the first to reveal the scientific genius of Pavlov and his
                            influence on
                            our daily life and thought and that alone accounts how a discussion on Pavlov and
                            Dhirendranath
                            is one and the same.
                        </p>
                        <p> It has to be necessarily remembered that Pavlov was born in Tzaristic Russia, although he
                            was a
                            jew, and worked for 19 years in Post-revolution Russia. On the otherhand Dhirendranath was
                            nutured in British India for 36 years. He started his research work on Pavlov in
                            post-independent India.There certainly was a difference between Pavlov's Russia and
                            Dhirendranath's Bengali society on social-economic ground. The uproar that took place due to
                            Tzar Alexander's work on reformations in Russia could be compared to the changes in
                            thought-current in so called Bengal Renaissance which affected every field of thought but
                            access
                            to European development in the medical science was not so easily available to Dhirendranath
                            as
                            it was to Pavlov.
                        </p>
                        <p> As such the opportunities that Pavlov enjoyed on his way to become a scientist was not
                            available
                            to Dhirendranath. Also there remained a long tradition of research in the field of
                            physiology in
                            Russia. That helped Pavlov to adopt research on physiology as the goal of life for more
                            easily
                            which was denied to Dhirendranath due to such meagre facilities in India. There also was a
                            lack
                            of such researchers in India who continued any work of research unabated on any subject
                            specially medicine. Further the science of psychology was by then coming out of philosophy
                            and
                            was almost being born as a separate and independent branch of medical science. In such an
                            uncertain field of career Dhirendranath opted for reaserch and profession in the arena of
                            psychology and he could see none who had done so in order that he could get an inspiration
                            as a
                            model. On the other hand Pavlov could drew his inspiration from scientists like Sechenov,
                            Tsion
                            and such other physiologists who were both powerful and worthy to be followed as ideal
                            teachers.
                            There was also a difference in the brain-type of Pavlov and Dhirendranath.

                        </p>
                        <p> It was in 1936 that Dhirendranath came to know Pavlov suddenly in Australia through Dr.
                            Bethune.
                            Prior to this he had heard about Pavlov like other students but was get yet to understand
                            the
                            importance of his work. He came to know of it from the works of Pavlov that Dr. Bethune left
                            behind on his way to Russia to attend the funeral of the former. Incidentally Dhirendranath
                            stayed in the same house where Dr. Bethune stayed when he had gone to Australia to learn the
                            process of manufacture of powdered milk. There he read the works of Pavlov and came to know
                            the
                            importance of research on neurophysiology which was to change the course of his desired
                            career
                            in life.
                        </p>
                        <p> Next came a period of conflict. Inspired by Acharya Prafulla Roy's ideal to make India
                            self-sufficient in the field of industrial business, Dhirendranath had thought of the
                            manufacture of powdered milk and he was the only holder of such a certificate in that field
                            in
                            India. He graduated from Calcutta Medical College in 1931 and went for relief work in
                            earhquake
                            stricken Bihar and he had no ambition to be a practising physician at that time. On his
                            return
                            from Bihar he, therefore, concentrated on the business of manufacture of powdered milk
                            following
                            the call of Acharya Prafulla Chandra Roy to make the country self-reliant through the spread
                            of
                            Industrial Business and that really prompted him to go forward on the line of his choice
                            without
                            any thought for treatment of patients as a medical practitioner. He went to Australia to
                            learn
                            the trade of his choice but within a few years he realised that to pursue the same was not
                            at
                            all smooth and easy. Within a short period he faced a great crisis in the business of his
                            choice
                            and settled in his Bhowanipur residence closing the trade that he very idealistically
                            started.

                        </p>
                        <p> In such a tight corner as above, Dhirendranath had the only option to start a profession as
                            a
                            medical practitioner and that he did being a practising psychiatrist privately. The time was
                            1945-46 and Dhirendranath was about 35 years of age. Initially he started his medical
                            practice
                            in the rented house of Bhowanipur and later in the rented house at Shyambazar permanently.
                        </p>
                        <p> Here it needs be remembered that Dhirendranath faced extreme poverty during his student days
                            and
                            it was then that he came in touch with active left politics which made it easier for him to
                            be a
                            social scientist rather than a psychiatrist. That was also a time when psychiatry did not
                            develop in our country as of today and that accounts for his work in that field as a pioneer
                            scientist. He was extremely successful as a practising psychiatrist in the later stage of
                            his
                            life and if his original contribution in hypnotic suggestion-therapy could be recorded
                            properly
                            then he would have been known as a front-line psychiatrist of the world but that was not
                            possible to be done and, therefore, it is not a place to discuss the same. Many do not know
                            that
                            apart from his social bondage he was attracted to revolutionary movements in pre-independent
                            India and was attracted to Marxism reading such literature.
                        </p>
                        <p> On his return from Australia he contacted the Russian Embassy to get hold of Pavlov's
                            research
                            works and pursue his studies in that direction. After this he was engaged in the business
                            production of powdered milk for 12-14 years but was unsuccessful in doing so. That made him
                            rent
                            a house around 1947-48 in Bhowanipur and start practice as a physician. There were may
                            choices
                            in his mind at that time but there was an interim period when he was not associated with
                            practising medicine. Tradition required him to learn the practice anew which was insulting
                            to
                            him and so he decided to work in such a field of medicine where he would not be compelled to
                            work as an intern.
                        </p>

                        <p> At that time he was urged to do something with his social consciousness which was developed
                            with
                            the integration of Pavlovian second signalling system and Marxian dialectical materialism
                            and
                            that prompted him in his choice to practise psychiatry.That apart he nurtured some boyhood
                            hobbies like football and drama. He wrote many plays and organised a play-group to stage
                            those
                            plays. We may now call those plays as India's first qualitatively composed psychodramas. He
                            also
                            decided to bring out a Bengali journal dedicated to the emancipation of the working class
                            through the individual emancipation of people in the perspective of Marxian social science,
                            social workers and the front runners of the party, educated in the modern trend. So in 1961
                            under his editorship was published quarterly Manabmon. It must be mentioned that the name
                            Manabmon came from Dhirendranath's young poet friend Arunachal Bose.
                        </p>
                        <p> From the above it is not difficult to understand that due mainly to social obligations
                            Dhirendranath was not able to concentrate either in physiology or in psychiatry and so he
                            spread
                            his life's activities in many diverse directions. Hence he was not able to get for himself
                            any
                            strict disciplined academic studies and research as Pavlov did. We could expect that from
                            him
                            had he gone to any Western country to pursue his research and psychiatry practice remaining
                            attached to any Institution in India. That helped many lesser people to earn greater honour
                            and
                            recognition in the field of psychiatry than him. Due to such negligence he immersed himself
                            fully in the socio-political thoughts in many diverse directions and started flowering in
                            such a
                            field day by day.
                        </p>
                        <p> In midst of all such activities enummerated above, he organised many seminars, discussions
                            and
                            himself participated in those. That undoubtedly spread the name and scientific works of
                            Pavlov
                            on Indian soil. This indeed is a mentionable fact in our social history and he participated
                            in
                            discussions wherever those were held and he was invited to participate. The only problem
                            remained in that the American Psychaitry Association did not support Pavlov's hypnotic
                            suggestion therapy and so the latter was not accorded the importance he deserved in India.
                            Pavlov's scientific discoveries, therefore, faced ridicule which was uncalled for
                            Dhirendranath,
                            inspite of his powerful influence and abilities, was not serious enough to establish the
                            great
                            scientific mind of Pavlov to psychiatrists of India to counter the ridicules that they
                            hurled at
                            Pavlov's thoughts unnecessarily.

                        <h3 id="theworkofpavlov">The Work of Pavlov</h3>

                        <p> Basic research on neurophysiology had started fairly at the time of Pavlov and the curious
                            readers would do well to read Daniel Todes Pavlov's Physiology Factory, published by Jhon
                            Hopkins University in 2002. However Pavlov had worked on Russia's tradition of systematic
                            research on physiology in such areas as cardiovascular system, digestive system, autonomic
                            nervous system etc.. Working that way Pavlov automatically entered into the baffeling
                            'psychic
                            secretion'. He was trained in various famous laboratories of Europe under renowned
                            physiologist
                            such as Hidenhen, Ludig and he had an idea of the nature and structure of physiological
                            laboratories. While carrying on his research as mentioned Pavlov discovered condition reflex
                            as
                            applied to the higher cortex of animals. Out of this research emerged laboratory made
                            experimental neurosis, orienting reflex (what it is?), personality types etc. Still a doubt
                            did
                            arise to their applications on human beings for the experiments were carried on dogs. That
                            made
                            Pavlov carry a different experiment.
                        </p>
                        <p> A small boy would fold his finger if electric shock was given to that part. It was an
                            unconditional reflex. If then a warning bell was sounded then the boy would fold his finger
                            hearing the bell itself. It was a preliminary conditional reflex. If now the word 'bell' was
                            written on a paper the boy would fold his finger looking at it. What experiment was it then?
                        </p>
                        <p> The above experiment had shown a conditional reflex concerning a bell in the boy's mind. The
                            bell sybmbolically through our language had given rise to a particular signal message. That
                            bell
                            consciousness created in him a special awareness regarding all known and unknown bells.
                            Knowledge of such human language from our infancy gives rise to such conditional reflex
                            within
                            us. Thus from the progress of our language learning the symbolic representations of events
                            that
                            we encounter from a chain of conditional reflexes in a very disciplined way. That phenomenon
                            has
                            been termed second signalling system. Because it develops through our unconditional reflexes
                            of
                            special signalling senses which we may call first signalling system.
                        </p>
                        <p> Pavlov through his theory of inhibition, also given the explanation of the phenomenon
                            hypnosis
                            acting on our nervous system. While working on animals Pavlov observed that there is a tone
                            in
                            the activities of the brain that controls our all such conscious activities such as
                            motivation,
                            memory, intelligence, attention, judgement etc.. Therefore the amount by which such tone
                            increases or decreases according to that the brain gets excited or depressed or awake or
                            sleepy
                            or hypnotic depending on different psychical state. Pavlov, at that time, had no access to
                            modern instruments in laboratories to measure accurately the physiological activities of the
                            organs of animals. Also knowledge of the composition and activities of the brain were very
                            limited then. Hence Pavlov's research on the human brain was based on hypothetico-deductive
                            method or according to Whewell-Wilson's term method of consilience (jumping together, just
                            opposite to reductionism). Later the students of Pavlov worked in this field in Russia and
                            East
                            Europe extensively.
                        </p>
                        <p> With the fruits of the labour of the foregone researches Dhirendranath started his
                            theoretical
                            work on the subject 'word as a psychotherapeutic factor'. The principle of this was to
                            employ
                            'words' as suggestion in psychotherapy or to use the same for treatment of psychiatry. For
                            we
                            make people laugh or cry or inspire with words. Thus Dhirendranath used Pavlov's research on
                            cerebral cortex practically in his psychiatry treatment.

                        </div>

                        <p> Later Dhirendranath went to Russia many times to see the research of Pavlov but was not
                            satisfied. He had presumed that the theory of conditioned reflex coupled with second
                            signalling
                            system could be stretched for further research in that direction which sadly was not done.
                            Therefore the treatment of psychiatry cases which Dhirendranath started here was
                            methodically
                            his very own and that reflected the original process of his individual approach to
                            psychiatry
                            and its treatment of psychiatry patients.

                        <p> It may also be said that psychiatry was not so common in India at that point of time though
                            Girindrasekhar started work in this field around 1930 in R.G.Kar Medical College but it was
                            not
                            systematically continued the way it should have been. In those days vagabond chronic
                            schizophrenics were commonly termed lunatics. At that time only three doctors worked in this
                            field --- they were Dhirendranath, Dr. Ajit Deb and Dr. Davis in Ranchi. Later Dr. Nagen
                            Dey, on
                            his return from England, started treating psychiatry patients. Also there was hardly any
                            medicine for psychiatry patients. When any patient was disturbed, he was given bromide and
                            if
                            depressed he was given caffeine. In the meantime the followers of Freud had organised Indian
                            Psychoanalytical Society during the Second World War. Dhirendranath introduced Pavlov in
                            India
                            much after that period. He called himself a follower of Pavlov but that was not highlighted
                            at
                            all and for this a few things could be held responsible.
                        </p>
                        <p> First and foremost was the fact that almost the entire intelligentsia including even the
                            leftists were deeply influenced by Freudian theory of psychoanalysis. Indian intelligentsia
                            with
                            a deep rooted colonial heritage and enveloped with Vedanta, was no exception. It was found
                            out
                            and preached that Pavlov was a Russian scientist and as such Stalin's communistic Russia
                            made
                            use of Pavlov's methods to brainwash the people of Russia. This assumption was then spread
                            all
                            over the world and Dhirendranath was stamped as a follower of that Russian method.That was
                            also
                            due to the fact Dhirendranath was a pronounced Marxist and most of his friends and
                            acquaintances
                            were such.
                        </p>
                        <p> Accepting such a situation as above Dhirendranath continued his Pavlov following but he was
                            not
                            attracted by Pavlov's strict discipline of research and its attempt at finding the truth.
                            Also
                            he opted for the establishment of an independent Institute of research on psychiatry rather
                            than
                            an attachment with an established Institution like the Medical College for such research. He
                            was
                            more interested in social science rather than physiology or medicine. He aimed at a change
                            of
                            the mental set-up of the majority of the people rather than an individual and that kept his
                            mind
                            occupied as a pioneer in the field of psychiatry in India as also Asia as an original
                            researcher
                            concerning the same. Such efforts turned him into an Institution himself.
                        </p>
                        <p> For an assessment of Dhirendranath's research we have to know the work of Pavlov very
                            briefly
                            because where the latter drew an end to his work, the former actually started his psychiatry
                            practice from there itself. Many complain that Pavlov put stress more on the quantitative
                            side
                            of physiology than on its qualitative aspect. This indeed is not correct as Pavlov tried to
                            equate both quantitative and qualitative aspects of the physiological activities of human
                            brain.
                            That was his own effort and its success was not fairly preached in the West. As such Pavlov
                            was
                            honoured more as a physiologist than a psychologist. It may be assumed that Western
                            scientists
                            took time to understand the effort of Pavlov's research in psychology through the medium of
                            the
                            neuroscience specially higher nervous system.
                        </p>
                        <p> That accounted for the hurdles which prevented true assessment of Pavlov's research stamping
                            it
                            as merely a materialistic work. Dhirendranath's research also grasped unnecessarily on
                            account
                            of that. He moved through the nook and corner of individual human brains and failed in his
                            efforts to systematise the many types of those and came to the conclusion that mental
                            diseases
                            could only be separated broadly. Human beings are self-similar and are all different
                            personality
                            types, so are their mental diseases and their treatments. The history of mental diseases and
                            their treatments have baffled doctors for fairly a long time because of such diversity or
                            individual uniqueness.
                        </p>
                        <p> If Dhirendranathhad only noted down his experiences then he would have been accorded world
                            recognition. Suffice it to say that we shall, therefore, discuss the merits of
                            Dhirendranath's
                            psychiatry practice in view of the research work of Pavlov.

                        <p> During the time when the medical science was rapidly progressing, psychiatry and psychiatric
                            treatment were also getting developed in its own way. The specialist doctors of various
                            diseases
                            were increasingly realising that mind and body were both connected very closely and so while
                            treating diseases of body, treatment of mental diseases was also necessary. As such with the
                            progress of medical treatment applying newer medicines came to be applied to psychiatry
                            comprising medicines that were not available earlier. Let us touch this subject a little in
                            detail.
                        </p>
                        <p> The father of psychology Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) was a contemporary of Pavlov and a
                            neurologist. He was influenced by the popular concept of physical science i.e. Law of
                            Conservation of Energy. But he was at the same time heavily influenced by German biologist
                            Ernst
                            Haeckel's (1834-1919) theory of recapitualtion i.e. ontogeny repeates its phylogeny.
                            Astonishingly throughout his life this recapitulation theory was his dominant focus in each
                            and
                            every writings.
                        </p>
                        <p> However Freud believed that vital energy, drive etc. are ingrained in people right from the
                            time
                            of birth and those move in the body till the time of death. As such the growth and
                            development
                            of a person would mean whether the said energy is transforming naturally or getting stuck
                            somewhere somehow. The different sectors of the body for such purpose are mouth, anus and
                            genitals. Therefore if energy or life force is stuck in those parts, then the personality of
                            a
                            person would likewise be influenced and psychological imbalance may also ensue. Freud had an
                            unique notion about mind that it is divided into conscious, unconscious, sub-conscious and
                            such
                            other compartments. So when Freud started his work with psychiatry patients then primarily
                            he
                            thought of the said compartments of the mind of each person and proposed his theories of
                            psychoanalysis, interpretation of dream and such other in connection with his free
                            association
                            method. Still his theories were mere theories substantiated by laboratory experiments but
                            some
                            earned recognition in applied psychotherapy and were being used in various parts of the
                            world
                            though Freud was never popular in the laboratory based scientific culture in Europe.
                        </p>
                        <p> In the movement of psychology or psychiatry such patients who were totally helpless had to
                            be
                            institutionalised as a social need. So for development of psychiatry demand of biological
                            therapy was increasing. Now on for the treatment of physical ailments, mental diseases were
                            considered or equated for treatment. For this electroconvulsive therapy, brain ablation and
                            inocculation of malarial parasite for creating fever were applied widely though a conflict
                            remained. It cannot be said that the conflict has ended by now though the importance of
                            keeping
                            the mental asylums clean and hygenic was recognised. Then psychotherapy sounded like
                            religious
                            message but in the fifties a revolution started in the field of treatment of psychiatry
                            after
                            introduction of drug chlorpromazine in France in 1950.

                        <p> In the above mentioned circumstances, after two World Wars when Europe was shattered,
                            leadership
                            in psychiatry like other fields of science gradually passed into the hands of America. Here
                            it
                            had to be said that conservative European Society did not accommodate it very healthy to
                            dissect
                            the human mind in laboratories. There the famous physiologist Sherrington did not felt
                            comfortable to go beyond spinal cord in research works. He was averse to the idea of
                            connecting
                            the central nervous system i.e. brain with the spinal cord. But Pavlov was fearless and
                            instead
                            of encouraging his research famous British physiologist Sherrington told him, ' Your
                            research
                            work smacks materialism, so it would not be popular here.'
                        </p>

                        <p> Here the development or honour due to Freud must be given. He thrashed the then Europe's
                            conservative societies concept regarding the double standard dealing between mind and soul
                            and
                            opposition to ideas on sex. What Freud did was to spread his ideas regarding sub-conscious
                            sexual suppression, death-eros, masochism, sadism etc. and that silenced the clergies and
                            the so
                            called leaders of the conservative societies. Still Freud failed to get the recognition due
                            to
                            him from scientists even though he was successful in uprooting the concept of 'soul' from
                            the
                            Europian society, as Laplace-Galelio-Newton and Darwin did it from the physical science and
                            biological science correspondingly.
                        </p>
                        <p> On the other hand when Freud went to America in 1908 he own the hearts and support of
                            general
                            physicians, psychologists, psychiatrists, neurologists and the society of the
                            intelligentsia.
                            Two American disciples of Freud namely Brill and Jones as also the dearth of theories of the
                            newly flowering studies of psychology contributed their might in establishing Freud in
                            America.
                            Also William James, the father of American psychology, suffered a heart attack just before
                            the
                            felicitation of Sigmund Freud was held. He suffered from chest pain while talking to Freud
                            and
                            was thus unable to say anything in opposition. That helped Freud conquer America and the
                            entire
                            world for by then America had gone up Europe in every way. The absolute truth of this became
                            further apparent after the two world wars. That also helped the spread of Freudian movement
                            among the progressive leftist intelligentsia of India.

                        <p> Dhirendranath had to wage his fight like Sabyasachi (Arjuna) against all opposition. Even
                            Dr.
                            Masani, the President of Psychoanalytical Society of India once said to Dhirendranath," You
                            look
                            to be lonely so if you want your own welfare then join us. Otherwise you would be crushed."
                        </p>
                        <p> Pavlov was truly an academician. On the otherhand Dhirendranath was one of the pioneers of
                            popular science able to express the different aspects of science in fluent Bengali, editor
                            of
                            Manabmon where he wrote on social science for the intelligentsia, a very successful
                            psychiatrist
                            and a dramatist. Still Indian Medical Community did not give him his due recognition inspite
                            of
                            his great qualities of head and heart but he would be greatly remembered in the history of
                            Indian science and philosophy.
                        </p>

                        </div>

                        <p> One has to think why Dhirendranath was not given due recognition in the present community of
                            doctors. The quotational part would be a little lengthy but on account of necessity a little
                            patience is prayed of the readers. In his essay entitled Bankimchandra regarding his
                            contribution to modern literature Rabindranath Tagore said, "... At a time when best
                            educated
                            Bankimchandra contributed his entire artistic genius at the lotus feet of Bengali language
                            and
                            the great work he did, that we fail to understand properly even today.
                        </p>
                        <p> Then many lesser people with lesser education than Bankimchandra used to swell up in pride
                            writing a few lines in English. Those people hardly realised that they were building sand
                            dams
                            like squirrels on the sea.
                        </p>
                        <p> Bankimchandra renounced such pride and honour of his time easily and devoted his entire
                            energy
                            for revealing the unknown to the educated people and there could hardly be anything more
                            courageous than that. Endowed with great power he overlooked the encouragement and honour
                            from
                            people of his type and equal and walked on an unexperimented, unknown and dark path
                            employing
                            his new life's all power, hope and energy with great courage and confidence. It is,
                            therefore,
                            not easy to measure the quality of Bankimchandra."

                        <p> The above hold good about the singular contributions of Dhirendranath too.
                        </p>
                        <p> The following are the possible reasons for a proper assessment of the contributions of
                            Dhirendranath in the untrodden field of the science of psychology in India and Asia as well.

                            <br><br>
                            1. Dhirendranath had no conventional specialisation (degree/diploma) in the field of
                            psychiatry. Many thought that he was not a specialist, just a quack or a behavior therapist.
                            <br>
                            2. He had no connection with the society of psychiatrists. On the otherhand Dhirendranath
                            was thoroughly disgusted at the limited power of innovation of then practising psychiatrists
                            and used to express the same. <br>
                            3. Many psychiatrists and physicians almost thought him to be untouchable as he was a
                            Marxist. A few Marxist physicians only knew party's programmes and slogans and nothing more.
                            That made Dhirendranath the only intelligentsia in his circle where he moved. <br>
                            4. The method of his treatment employed hypnosis. That made his contemporary psychiatrists
                            think that in the pretext of treatment Dhirendranath used to cheat and hoodwink people. <br>
                            5. Finally Dhirendranath was not attached to any Medical Institution or any educational
                            Institution.
                        </p>

                        <p> Dhirendranath was perhaps unable to get any student in his life because of the reasons cited
                            above. At the fag end of his life he got some unworthy young psychiatrists who have kept his
                            Institution lighted now. This indeed is not a happy state of affairs.
                        </p>

                        <p> In this context a few facts may be borne in mind. Dhirendranath never accepted the
                            membership of
                            Marxist party nor was he its blind supporter. He helped many people in diverse ways.
                            Naxalite
                            Amulya Sen (Masterda) did hide in his house day after day. Gopal Halder, Hiren Mukherjee and
                            Bhupesh Gupta were his close associates. Poet Arunachal Basu looked at him as God and Manik
                            Sarkar of S.U.C.I. used to bring patients to him paying Rs.1 as his visit. The present chief
                            minister of this state used to spend time gossiping with Dhirendranath in his Shyambazar
                            residence. He treated many political leaders and workers and helped them generously. His
                            name
                            always appeared in the signature paper of A.P.D.R. and Kapil Bhattacharya organised his
                            first
                            meeting in his house. On his return from China Hemanga Biswas narrated his experience in his
                            house. In his stewardship 'Reflection of contemporary contradiction and alienation on the
                            mind
                            of an artist' was discussed in series seminars. Such and many more instances would prove
                            that he
                            was a complete social man and was never afraid to express his views on any subject freely.

                        <p> Dhirendranath in his young age helped the secret terrorist parties working as couriers and
                            supplied arms collecting those from Khidirpore Docks. Later the whole society of his
                            motherland
                            was his entire life's research laboratory. He used to think, write and discuss about every
                            subject concerning the people and the society of this country. But he hated disturbance,
                            unlike
                            Pavlov, as he lacked Pavlov's courage. He used to shy away from anything that seemed to brew
                            any
                            disturbance and fearing insult used to think a number of times before asking for any help
                            from
                            anyony for his Institution. Still it must be said that he was greatly helped by his friends
                            and
                            he often said that he was fortunate to get helping friends all around him.
                        </p>
                        <p> What efforts did Dhirendranath initiate to establish his Institute's laboratory as Pavlov's
                            student? Let a brief history of the same be said for the understanding of encouraging
                            readers as
                            there were only one or two private Institutions when an Institute of Psychology or
                            Psychiatry
                            was being planned. That made the proposed Institute not only the first of its kind in India
                            but
                            in Asia too. On many occasions he planned to set up his desired Institute but dearth of
                            money
                            barred him from realising his desire. He could only organise a few workshops on psychiatry
                            but
                            failed to train general primary care physician in somatizations and psychosomatic disorders
                            of
                            treating patients on financial grounds.
                        </p>
                        <p> It might be recalled that in 1974 under the leadership of the then Chairman of Central Drug
                            Control Unit, Dr. Bishnu Mukherjee a great search for a house in North 24 Parganas was made
                            for
                            Pavlov Institute's own laboratory. Also a few publications in English were made in that
                            direction but all efforts did not last long. It must be mentioned that Dhirendranath went to
                            Russia thrice but was not satisfied by the work being done on Pavlov and did not show any
                            interest to work in that field here.
                        </p>
                        <p> On the other hand American psychiatrist Gnat established a laboratory to work on Pavlov's
                            research concerning higher nervous activities in 1930 learning the method from Russia. That
                            spread the achievements of Pavlov among the English speaking nations.
                        </p>
                        <p> One more fact needs be said that Dhirendranath ran his Institute and research alone without
                            any
                            help from anyone. If asked the reason behind such solitary position of his, then he jokingly
                            said that Bengalees are like amoeba and so their number must be kept lesser and lesser
                            otherwise
                            the Institute would be shattered for there is hardly any example where five able Bengalees
                            have
                            done anything together. Also it would have to be borne in mind that to keep the light of his
                            Institution glowing, Dhirendranath continually suffered from financial plight.
                        </p>
                        <p> Pavlov was a laboratory based scientist, Dhirendranath was primarily a practitioner of
                            psychiatry yet was a scientist with a difference. Dhirendranath worked on psychology,
                            psychiatry, social science, physiology etc.. On account of that Dhirendranath's due
                            recognition
                            took time in the West as those branches were not recognised as science. That way none knows
                            when
                            will he be accepted as a scientist in India.
                        </p>
                        <p> Philosopher Debiprasad Chattopadhyay named four great men as truly scientific minded. Akshoy
                            kumar dutta and Prafulla Chandra Roy in the 19th century and Satyendranath Basu and Meghnad
                            Saha
                            in the 20th Century. But there is no dearth of talented people in Bengal and judging from
                            all
                            angles we may call Dhirendranath truly a scientist minus any glamour as he was not a
                            Professor
                            on any renowned College or University. He was just a practitioner psychiatrist and as such
                            quack
                            to many people who failed to know him properly. His due recognition stumbles further as he
                            was a
                            confirmed Marxist trying his best to establish dialectical materialism in Indian tradition
                            of
                            thought. The naked attack of non-Marxist academicians from all fronts pricked him throughout
                            his
                            life. That made him work silently in almost an island of his own thought he could not
                            overcome a
                            disappointment that even his close associates failed to appreciate his pioneering work in
                            psychology and psychiatry. In spite of all such obstacles, Dhirendranath did not waver even
                            an
                            inch from his ideology and social responsibility as a psychiatrist and social activist.

                        <p> It is surprising to note that after Girindrasekhar, the only man who with some originality
                            practised psychiatry and psychology was none other than Dhirendranath and he alone could
                            claim
                            an authority to that new branch of mental health and neuroscience. He was a product of the
                            Bengal renaissance and it was difficult to find a man his equal at his own time. His
                            writings
                            have yet to be translated in English to make him known to other provinces. Perhaps lack of
                            proper academic discipline left much of his work neglected. Still it is surprising to note
                            that
                            for about fifty years he continiously worked on the psychology and psychiatry innovating
                            newer
                            ways and methodology. Examples of those are as enumerated below:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            1. When in the treatment of psychiatry, psychotherapy or counselling were not applied
                            anywhere in the world, Dhirendranath in 1950 had worked with hypnosis and its concommitants
                            in Calcutta itself. Such psychotherapeutic method of treatment was his own discovery and no
                            research was done on it even in Russia. He started making audiocassettes on the subject of
                            hypnotic-suggestion therapy from 1978 though in India apply of hypnosis in treatment method
                            was thought to be immoral in the footsteps of American Psychiatric Association which had
                            banned it. After many considerations the method was adopted in the sixties in America yet
                            Dhirendranath was ridiculed for such treatment method and he had to work with it. <br><br>
                            2. He used to apply medicines to psychiatry patients in his own way. While treating a
                            patient he used to judge his Pavlovian brain type and treated him accordingly. Dhirendranath
                            did not accept the Western method of application of medicine to a person considering the
                            weight of his body and that created arguments among his students. Later Dhirendranath's
                            method was found correct, as the brain of a patient, it was seen, could hardly tolerate all
                            medicines applied in the conventional psychiatry. <br><br>
                            3. Before accepting such method of treatment he opined that it was very difficult to
                            categorise psychiatric patients and so the patient's brain type and social class had to be
                            considered. It was difficult to accept his opinion for without classification, treatment of
                            psychiatry patient was not at all easy. We realise how Dhirendranath struggled against such
                            odds working in the field of psychiatry. Of late Indian Psychiatry Society in December 2002
                            has published a pamphlet and sent the same to its members highlighting the problems that
                            Dhirendranath had encountered and for which many people did not hesitate to call him a quack
                            too. <br><br>
                            4. He was very much opposed to the use of E.C.T. or electroconvulsive therapy and used to
                            raise his voice against its use whenever he got a chance. Nowadays all psychiatrists agree
                            that use of E.C.T. must be done very sparingly and carefully if at all needed to do so. <br><br>
                            5. It is now being said in the movement of mental diseases that psychiatry patients must be
                            freed from Asylums and Institutions and brought back to families. It is interesting that
                            Dhirendranath said so around 1950 (documented in Manabmon), far ahead of the present
                            movement.
                        </p>

                        <p> Dhirendranath said around 1950 that chronic schizophrenics must be counted as mentally
                            handicapped and yet this demand is to be realised.
                        </p>
                        <p> Many people do not know that Dhirendranath was publicly honoured for his works in 1986 and
                            the
                            mental hospital at Gobra was named Pavlov Hospital and he was named the Chairman of the
                            advisory
                            council but he and his students had to leave the place due to political turmoil. Looking at
                            the
                            psychiatrists there it is suspected if they have at all heard the name of Pavlov and his
                            research.
                        </p>
                        <p> Leaving aside rivalry and narrow-mindedness in our poor and backward country it is now our
                            duty
                            to properly preserve the fruits of research and present that to the mankind. We must never
                            forget that he represented an entire century in his field. That accounts for the fact that
                            many
                            thoughts and many researches are all stored in his writings representing a century itself.
                            Our
                            efforts should be to scientifically analyse and follow the fruits of his painstaking works
                            spreading fifty years. It is not that we are not trying but to know the true talents such a
                            big
                            person we ought to be equipped further. We rearly have not been able to initiate true
                            research
                            following his example but hope to do so in the future.
                        </p>
                        <p> Still we shall carry on the work of establishing with honour the names of Pavlov and
                            Dhirendranath as great scientists of higher nervous system. We believe that those who bear
                            the
                            flag get the needed inspiration to do so. We hope that we shall have both power and energy
                            to do
                            so.
